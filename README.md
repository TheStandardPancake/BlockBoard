# BlockBoard
A block chain message board kind of like paste bin or twitter essentially. 
Being decentralised in theory it becomes a completely uncensorable message board.
Honestly I'm only doing this to see if it would work, I discourage use of it as in being programmed by me, a casual python programmer using a new language (c++), it's security is likely not ensured. Especially seeing as it deals with p2p connections.
