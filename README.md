# BlockBoard
A block chain paste bin essentially. 
Being decentralised in theory it becomes a completely uncensorable message board that persists like a virus, only it survives on voluntary hosts... weird idea right.
Honestly I'm only doing this to see if it would work, I discourage use of it as in being programmed by me, a casual python programmer using a new language (c++), it's security is likely not ensured.
