# BlockBoard
A block chain message board kind of like paste bin or twitter essentially.

Kind of a proof of concept for a freedom of speech thought experiment as being decentralised in theory it
becomes a completely
uncensorable message board.

Honestly I'm mainly doing this to learn c++ and explore blockchain technologies, I discourage use of it as in
being programmed by me, a casual python programmer
using a new language, it's security is likely not ensured. Especially seeing as it deals with p2p connections.

Ethically there could be a case made against something like this, and this is why it is only a proof of concept
to prompt discussion and deeper thought about the future nature of the internet if "web 3.0" truly takes off.

THIS PROJECT WON'T BE DEVELOPED INTO A FINALISED AND WIDELY ACCESSIBLE PORDUCT, ONCE I AM SATISFIED WITH BASIC
FUNCTIONALITY IN A LOCAL NETWORK SETTING, DEVELOPMENT WILL CEASE AND UPDATES WILL LIKELY NEVER HAPPEN.
